# MCMC-PokerHandStrength
Poker Hand Strength estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo for my Mathematics Senior Seminar

In poker, especially after the Turn, players often face an important question: How strong
is my hand given what I know, and what my opponents might be holding? This project
explores that question using a simulation-based approach. The result is a probabilistic
model that balances poker intuition with structured simulation, producing outputs that are
both interpretable and grounded in actual gameplay dynamics.
